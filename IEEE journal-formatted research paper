Abstract

Hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are widely recognized as a zero tailpipe emission mobility solution. However, most implementations optimize performance at the individual vehicle level, lacking coordinated fleet-scale intelligence. This paper introduces the QUENNE Hydrogen Mobility Ecosystem (QHME), a layered stacked-intelligence architecture integrating vehicle-level model predictive control, fleet-level optimization, predictive maintenance modeling, and cybersecurity hardening within a unified governance framework. QHME extends conventional FCEV propulsion by embedding real-time orchestration and safety-prioritized control logic across vehicle, fleet, and hydrogen infrastructure domains. A hybrid optimization framework combining model predictive control (MPC), mixed-integer fleet scheduling, and degradation-aware energy allocation is presented. System-level benefits include improved hydrogen utilization efficiency, extended stack lifespan, reduced downtime, and enhanced safety isolation. The proposed architecture offers a scalable blueprint for smart city hydrogen mobility networks.

I. Introduction

Hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) provide a promising pathway toward decarbonized transportation. Unlike battery electric vehicles, FCEVs enable rapid refueling and high energy density suitable for heavy-duty and fleet applications. Despite advancements in fuel cell stack efficiency and power electronics, most FCEV systems remain locally optimized, with minimal coordination across fleet infrastructure.

This paper proposes the QUENNE Hydrogen Mobility Ecosystem (QHME), a multi-layered intelligent architecture that extends vehicle propulsion optimization into fleet-scale orchestration. By integrating stacked-intelligence governance, predictive modeling, and cybersecurity isolation, QHME aims to transform hydrogen vehicles into coordinated energy nodes within smart city networks.

II. System Architecture

A. Layered Stacked-Intelligence Framework

The QHME architecture follows a hierarchical structure:
	1.	Human Authority Layer
	2.	Ethical & Safety Governance Layer
	3.	Mission Intelligence Layer
	4.	Real-Time Orchestration Layer
	5.	Engineering Algorithm Layer
	6.	Linux Runtime & Hardware Abstraction

Safety logic is enforced at lower layers and cannot be overridden by optimization routines.

⸻

B. Vehicle Energy Flow Model

Energy conversion follows:

Hydrogen → PEM Fuel Cell Stack → DC/DC Converter → HV Bus → Inverter → Motor → Wheels

Battery buffering provides transient smoothing and regenerative capture.

The instantaneous power balance is:

P_{demand}(t) = P_{stack}(t) + P_{battery}(t)

Subject to:

P_{stack}^{min} \leq P_{stack}(t) \leq P_{stack}^{max}

SOC_{min} \leq SOC(t) \leq SOC_{max}

⸻

III. Fleet-Level Optimization Framework

A. Objective Function

Fleet optimization minimizes the weighted cost function:

J = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \left[
\alpha H_2(t)
+ \beta D_{stack}(t)
+ \gamma Downtime(t)
+ \delta StationWait(t)
\right]

Where:
   •   H_2(t) represents hydrogen consumption
   •   D_{stack}(t) approximates degradation stress
   •   Downtime(t) represents service interruption
   •   StationWait(t) represents infrastructure inefficiency

Weights \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta are configurable according to fleet policy.

⸻

B. Degradation Modeling

Stack degradation penalty is approximated as:

D_{stack} \approx k_1 |\Delta P_{stack}| + k_2 T_{exposure}

where load variability and high-temperature exposure accelerate membrane aging.

⸻

C. Optimization Strategy

QHME employs a hybrid approach:
   •   Model Predictive Control (vehicle level)
   •   Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (fleet scheduling)
   •   Reinforcement Learning (long-term adaptive policy tuning)

Safety constraints are treated as hard constraints.

⸻

IV. Predictive Maintenance Modeling

Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation is approximated via:

RUL = a_0 + a_1 V_{drift} + a_2 T_{cycles} + a_3 Load_{variance}

Telemetry inputs include:
   •   Stack voltage drift
   •   Thermal cycling frequency
   •   Compressor loading patterns

This enables maintenance scheduling prior to catastrophic failure.

⸻

V. Cybersecurity & Safety Isolation

QHME implements a defense-in-depth model:
	1.	Hardware root-of-trust
	2.	Secure boot chain
	3.	mTLS vehicle-cloud communication
	4.	Policy-gated command interface
	5.	Immutable audit ledger

Safety isolation ensures cyber compromise cannot disable hydrogen isolation or high-voltage cutoff systems.

Compliance alignment includes ISO 21434 and UNECE R155 frameworks.

VI. Smart City Integration

Fleet telemetry integrates with hydrogen station infrastructure through:
   •   Demand forecasting
   •   Refueling window optimization
   •   Queue management
   •   Emissions reduction reporting

The system enables coordinated hydrogen logistics at city scale.

⸻

VII. Discussion

Compared to conventional FCEV fleets, QHME introduces:
   •   Coordinated optimization across vehicles
   •   Degradation-aware control policies
   •   Infrastructure-level intelligence
   •   Formalized safety governance

Potential benefits include:
   •   Hydrogen savings (estimated 5–15%, subject to empirical validation)
   •   Extended stack lifespan
   •   Reduced downtime
   •   Improved station utilization

Further real-world testing is required to validate performance gains.

⸻

VIII. Limitations & Future Work
   •   Infrastructure dependency
   •   Stack cost constraints
   •   Real-world degradation uncertainty
   •   Regulatory harmonization
   •   Large-scale field validation

Future research includes:
   •   Digital twin simulation frameworks
   •   Real-time hydrogen market integration
   •   AI-driven policy learning
   •   Cross-city hydrogen balancing

IX. Conclusion

The QUENNE Hydrogen Mobility Ecosystem proposes a scalable, safety-governed, and optimization-driven framework for hydrogen fleet transportation. By extending intelligence beyond the vehicle into coordinated fleet orchestration, QHME offers a systematic approach to hydrogen mobility suitable for smart city deployment.
