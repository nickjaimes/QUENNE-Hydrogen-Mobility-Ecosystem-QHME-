# QHME Cybersecurity Hardening v1.1

---

# 1. Defense-in-Depth Strategy

Layer 1: Hardware Root of Trust
Layer 2: Secure Boot
Layer 3: Encrypted Communication
Layer 4: Behavioral Anomaly Detection
Layer 5: Policy Enforcement & Audit

---

# 2. Vehicle Security Enhancements

- TPM or secure enclave key storage
- Signed firmware verification chain
- Sensor authenticity validation
- Intrusion detection on CAN / internal bus
- Runtime memory integrity monitoring

---

# 3. Cloud Security Hardening

- Zero-trust network segmentation
- WAF + API rate limiting
- Signed event validation
- Immutable ledger (append-only)
- SIEM integration

---

# 4. OTA Update Hardening

- Dual-partition fail-safe
- Cryptographic hash verification
- Rollback threshold triggers
- Canary deployment per fleet %

---

# 5. Safety-Cyber Cross Isolation

Cyber anomaly cannot:
- Disable hydrogen isolation
- Modify safety thresholds
- Bypass leak detection logic

Safety firmware runs in isolated execution domain.

---

# 6. Incident Response Model

Detection → Classification → Containment → Recovery → Forensic Audit

Automated escalation rules:
- CRITICAL safety anomaly → vehicle isolation
- Repeated auth failures → token revocation
- Suspicious telemetry patterns → quarantine mode

---

# 7. Compliance Alignment

Designed to align with:

- ISO 21434 (Automotive Cybersecurity)
- UNECE WP.29 R155
- ISO 26262 (Functional Safety interface)
- IEC 62443 (Industrial Security principles)
