Executive Summary

The QUENNE Hydrogen Mobility Ecosystem (QHME) proposes a fully integrated hydrogen vehicle propulsion and fleet optimization architecture built upon the QUENNE Stacked Intelligence framework.

Unlike conventional hydrogen vehicles that focus solely on onboard propulsion efficiency, QHME expands the system boundary to include:

• Intelligent vehicle control (Q-HDU)
• Fleet-level AI optimization
• Hydrogen infrastructure coordination
• Predictive maintenance
• Safety-governed orchestration
• Smart city integration

The result is a scalable hydrogen mobility platform optimized for:

• Urban fleets
• Public transportation
• Logistics networks
• Sustainable smart cities

1. Introduction

Hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are widely recognized as a zero-tailpipe-emission solution. However, most implementations operate as isolated vehicles without systemic coordination.

QHME addresses this gap by introducing:

A layered cognitive architecture governing hydrogen propulsion from component level to city-scale optimization.
